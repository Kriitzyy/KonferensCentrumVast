# KonferensCentrumVast
Conference Center West AB’s booking system currently runs on a local server and cannot handle the company’s growth. The project is to migrate and modernize the system to the cloud (Azure).

Backend: ASP.NET Core API → migrate to Azure

Database: PostgreSQL → move to Azure Database

Frontend: React app (small changes, mainly for file upload)

What must be done:
Deploy API & frontend online with custom URL

Implement secure file upload (contracts, images) using Azure Storage

Automate email notifications with Azure Functions

Secure configurations & sensitive data (Key Vault, GDPR compliance)

Configure auto-scaling, monitoring, centralized logging, and automated backups
